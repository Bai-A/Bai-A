# Chord Intersection Counter

## Overview
This Python module provides a solution for counting the number of intersections between chords in a circle. Given a set of chords defined by their start and end points in radians, the `Solution` class's `countIntersections` method calculates the total number of intersections between these chords.

## Implementation
The implementation involves organizing the start and end points of the chords and counting intersections as they occur across the sweep of the circle.

### Methodology
- The chords are processed in sorted order of their radian measures.
- Each chord is represented by a start ('s') and an end ('e') identifier along with its radian measure.
- The algorithm keeps track of the currently active chords and counts intersections based on the relative positions of their start and end points.

### Complexity
- The overall time complexity of the `countIntersections` method is **O(n log n)**.
- This complexity arises from sorting the start and end events and the use of a binary search algorithm to find the correct position of each chord's end in the list of active chords.
- The space complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the number of chord start and end events.

## Usage
To use this module, create an instance of the `Solution` class and call the `countIntersections` method with the required parameters.

### Example
```python
sol = Solution()
radianMeasures = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
identifiers = ('s1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5', 'e3', 'e2', 'e1', 'e4', 'e5')
print(sol.countIntersections((radianMeasures, identifiers)))
